AIV Simple Game Engine for first year students


This is the core of the AIV (Accademia Italiana Videogiochi) Game Engine, targeted at first year students. It is a 2D engine written in C# with support for animated sprites, simple geometric forms (rectangles, circles, lines ...) text and tilemaps.

Basic sound is supported via System.Media.SoundPlayer.

This specific version runs over Windows.Forms (both Microsoft and Mono implementations) so you get no hardware acceleration. If you want an hardware accelerated version (via OpenGL/OpenGL-ES) check the aivegine-opentk repository: https://github.com/aiv01/aivengine-opentk

Most of the design choices are driven by the goal of introducing Unity3D in the second year.

The engine is released as GPL2, but you can get commercial licensing or support (as well as training courses) by simply contacting info at aiv01.it or info at 20tab.com
